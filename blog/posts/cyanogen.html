<p>There has been some hype about the new Android 6.0 Marshmallow, Just a couple of days ago, Samsung released their modified version of it to their S6 and S6 Edge terminals. Some manufacturers are announcing some of their smartphones as "can be upgraded Android 6.0". The fact is that Android 6.0 is here and it brings many different features and optimizations from the former "5.1 Lollipop".</p>

<p>My current phone is a Samsung Galaxy S4, Samsung tends to forget older models as they release the new ones so I got stuck with Android 4.4. I was very displeased because I thought the S4 was a high-end phone and It should last a couple of years. How did I managed to get Android 6.0 in my S4? Using CyanogenMod.</p>

<h3>Cyanogenmod</h3>

<p>The Android Open Source Project (AOSP) has spawned several different OSes or ROMs, like Paranoid Android and CyanogenMod. CyanogenMod is an enhanced version of Android, it provides features not available in official releases of Android because of restrictions made by manufacturers. I also does not contain any custom apps introduced by the vendor, for example, Samsung ships their phones and tablets with tons of built-in apps and even their own app-store. CyanogenMod gives us the posibility to enjoy a clean Android version, Google Apps are not even included! For more info on CyanogenMod, you can visit their <a class="post-link" href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/">official website.</a></p>

<h3>First Glance</h3>
<p>Marshmallow has a similar look from previous versions of Android, specifically 5.1. Material Design is more present than ever. I don't find to much changes from Lollipop.</p>
<p class="center"><img class="pure-img" style="max-width:300px;" src="/img/lockscreen.jpg"></p>
<p>Since CyanogenMod comes without Google Apps, I also installed Open Gapps Nano Edition, which includes The Play Store, Google Play Services and some google apps that can't be downloaded from the Play Store. With these installed I had a fairly clean and functional Android Installation. The next step was installing some replacements for the Open Source apps that come bundled with AOSP.</p>
<h4>Trebuchet</h4>
<p>The main screen or home screen is the launcher. Here the CyanogenMod guys include a launcher called Trebuchet, its a good looking one but the app list is rather confusing at first just because I am not used to having my apps sorted alphabetically, but after some minutes I found it really useful. If you want to experience a more traditional launcher you can try installing Nova.<p>

<p class="center"><img class="pure-img" src="/img/launcher.jpg" style="max-width:300px"><img class="pure-img" src="/img/trebuchet.jpg" style="max-width:300px"></p>

<h3>New Features</h3>
<p>Android M has come with several new features beyond look and feel, concerning security and performance, lets review what I found most useful/important.</p>

<h4>App permissions</h4>
<p>This is where you can really see some differences since Android 5.1. Previously when you installed an app, you had to look through all of the permissions that app required, it was a little weird like "Why do this messaging app needs my camera or my local storage?". With these new feature for example Telegram will ask if it can access the camera when you try to send a photo on a chat, you can even deny it because you never send pictures from camera.</p>

<p class="center"><img class="pure-img" src="/img/permissions.jpg" style="max-width:300px"></p>

<p>I believe this was made to prevent apps from asking permissions for everything at install time in which you didn't know why they were asking for that particular one, and you had to agree with all to install it. This can prevent from apps trying to record mic or camera without you knowing because now it will have to ask the permission to use them before attempting to do so.</p>

<p>Once installed, you can check the app permisions via settings > apps, there you can revoke or grant permissions on apps to enable some features you may want from them. For example I enabled the use of storage for Spotify so I could download my music.</p>
<p class="center"><img class="pure-img" src="/img/spotify-permissions.jpg" style="max-width:300px"></p>


<h4>Doze</h4>

<p>This is a feature that you can't really see. It consists on a service running in the background that rejects requests of other apps to download or use the network while they are in background, this is to prevent high usage of mobile data and wi-fi which translates to more battery life.</p>

<p>I don't really feel the difference of battery life but that may be beacuse I just installed Android M and it may take a while to really notice the improvements on battery life.</p>

<h4>SD Cards</h4>

<p>This is where I think it has gone wrong. Now when you connect or insert an SD card, it gives you two options, to keep the card "as is" and use it for multimedia storage like photos, music and videos or format the card, erase al the contents an use it as "internal memory" so it can be used as internal storage for apps or so.</p>

<p>My first thought was, "Cool, why wouldn't I want to use it as internal storage?", well here's the catch: When you format the SD card to be used as internal storage it also gets encrypted, so if you take the SD card out of the phone to transfer some data to other device it just won't work. The apps that where installed on the SD card will not longer work until you plug it in again and the other device won't recognize de SD card.</p>

<p>My recommendation here would be to only use it as internal storage in case you've got a very fast SD card and you don't usually transfer data using it, otherwise use it as multimedia and if you need to install apps on it like on older Android versions you can try App2SD (you may need root for it to work, I haven't tried it)</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>

<p>This is where it shines, I feel my phone faster than before, there are many reasons for this the first one was getting rid of all those samsung apps that I didn't need, then getting rid of Samsung's launcher TouchWiz, which had huge resource usage. Apart from that, which I also noticed when I first installed cyanogenmod - Android 5.0, the performance of the phone has gotten even better</p>

<p>Memory usage is lower than before : 900mb of 2GB, before on Android 5.1 on average it was 1.2GB. You can also select which apps do you want to be started on boot so you can only start the mandatory ones and have some extra free RAM, the phone also feels faster and smoother.</p>

<p class="center"><img class="pure-img" src="/img/memory.jpg" style="max-width:300px"></p>

<p>Battery life should be better but I don't find any substantial difference maybe beacuse this version of Cyanogenmod has not yet been fully optimized.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Marshmallow may not appear to have big changes, just because the interface is fairly similar to Lollipop but underneath it has some new features respecting performance, battery life and security which I believe is as important as UI changes.</p>

<p>In overall, Marshmallow seems a pretty good evolution of Android that focuses on main and important changes, I suspect future versions of Android will continue whith small improvements like this one.</p>
